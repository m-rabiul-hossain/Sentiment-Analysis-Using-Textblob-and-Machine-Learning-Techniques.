# Sentiment Analysis Based on Online Course Feedback Using Textblob and Machine Learning Techniques

We analyzed the students' sentiments regarding their courses based on their feedback on
online courses and tried to predict their sentiments. 

# Dataset
We have used the Coursera Course Reviews Dataset, which contains
107018 data records of used reviews and comments.

# Algorithms
Six machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
Random Forests, and the AdaBoost) were applied with four
performance measurement metrics. 

#Result
One of our models, Logistic Regression, outperformed the other models with an
accuracy of 97.31%. Our findings demonstrate that our model
achieved the highest possible accuracy compared to previous
relevant studies in this particular domain.
